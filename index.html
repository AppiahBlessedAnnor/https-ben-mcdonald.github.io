<h3>About me</h3>
</div>
<article>
<div class="cont">
<p>
I'm a student at RMIT Melbourne studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. This will be my second degree as I previously
studied and recieved my bachelor in Audio Production, graduating in 2016. Since then I have worked as a production and post production sound tech in film. I eventally moved to Toronto, Canada where I worked as an AV tech for two years. In 2019
I moved back to Melbourne and continued to work as an AV tech at Crown casino. In my off time I like to go to the beach and
work on my contact staff skills.

<h3>Why IT</h3>
</div>
<article>
<div class="cont">
<p>My interests in IT are mainly in the area of artificial intelligence, although, I'm also interested in AR and VR.
I have always thought the idea of creating a program that could think for itsself and make decisions just like
we do would be cool. Now we're in the year 2020 and technology is doing things we thought we'd only see in movies when we were back in the 90's.
At the end of 2019 I decided I wanted to learn how to create my own programs so that I could eventually work on designing
AI. After searching through the different courses that universities were offering I eventually decided on RMIT. While
studying, I hope to learn as much as possible about AI, AR, VR, and get to know the ins and outs of the world of IT.

<h3>My Ideal job</h3>
</div>
<article>
<img src="Desirable job.png" alt="Ideal job" width="501" height="298">
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/41037599?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=e750606a-3288-4a19-b709-05f3c942f24b" target="_blank">seek.com.au/VROC</a><br><br>
<p>As mentioned earlier my goal is to work on artificial intelligence. This is an ad for a position with VROC as a software engineer.
This job involves "working with the development team to improve their data processing framework to make use of the latest data programs and AI technologies".
Of course I'm just paraphrasing what the advertisement says, and in the grand scheme of things I hope to work more directley with AI. However, this position
would no doubt provide me with a new and helpful perspective on how to improve AI technologies and determine what companies want. It would also be a great
opportunity to develope new skills and learn from other professionals who have worked on other projects. An opportunity I most definitley would not pass up.</p>
<div class="title">
<h4>The skills required for this job are:</h4>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<ul>
<li>Experience with JavaScript, Typescript, REST API design, Grafana Plugin Development and Angular.js</li>
<li>Experience coding and creating prototypes in a fast paced enviroment</li>
<li>Have an understanding of new and upcoming trends across new technology solutions in the big data and artificial
intelligence industry</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="title">
<h4>My current skills are:</h4>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<ul>
<li>Basic JavaScript</li>
<li>Basic HTML</li>
<li>Basic CSS</li>
<li>Intermediate Audio knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, at my current skill level I would find this job near impossible. However, with time and training I am certain I could get this job once I've completed my degree.</p>
<p>My plan to attain the skills I need to secure this job is to work through my degree at RMIT and learn as much as I possibly can from the course, the lecturers, and 
other students. Of course that won't be enough to secure an upper level job like this one. So I also plan to work in IT as soon as I have enough knowledge to land an
entry level job. This will give me a chance to learn from professionals on the job while working my way up to a higher level job. As a bonus I plan to take every opportunity to
meet potential mentors in the industry.</p>

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
</div>
<article>
<div class="cont">
<p>In this section I have taken three tests: a personality test, a learning style test, and a creativity test. Here are the results of the
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/225d3c05a9ef7" target="_blank">Myers-Briggs test</a>
It would seem that I am a "turbullent Campaigner". According to the test I think more with my heart than my head, but only by a marginal amount.
I'm imaginitive and open minded, which is great when it comes to new ideas. I'm an opportunist who's great at improvising. I'm success driven and prone to stress. Though I don't believe 
all of this to be true, it does fit my personality in many ways. Stress is definitley a problem I've had trouble with in the past and I am very goal driven. I'm a bit of a dreamer 
which has always been a plus when it comes to creativity in both my work and social life. Improvisation is a skill I'm more than happy to brandish. In a team, these attributes
can be used to our advantage. When forming a team it would absolutely help to have someone who can see the big picture as I do have a tendency to get caught up
in the details. It also helps when I have someone to bounce ideas off who gives constructive criticizm and isn't afraid to chime in. All in all, I'm very easy to get along with
 and I will be an asset, especially when it comes to presentation time.</p>
<p>The second set of results are from the <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-results.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=7&T=7&N=Ben%20McDonald" target="_blank">"Learning style test"</a> on educationplaner.org.
 The test indicates that I'm a visual/tactile learner. This basically means I learn best by seeing and doing, which makes sense as that's how I've learned most of what I know today.
 I'm relatively organized with my work and learn best when I get to tinker with, or try, the task as it's being explained. Having a chance to tinker works well with creativity which, in all
 honesty, is how I like to work. I would say this test is quite accurate in its description of my learning style. In a team enviroment this will prove useful when we are faced with a
 technical issue due to the fact that if I tinker with something long enough I can usually figure out the problem rather quickly. When choosing a team I should work with someone who
 likes to demonstrate what they are doing, but also doesn't mind letting me take the wheel when things aren't working the way we hoped.</p>
 <p> The final test is a creativity test from <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/share/78C5aCF0d04d" target="_blank">Testmycreativity.com</a>. According to the test, the most prominent aspects of my creativity are: boldness, paradox, curiosity, and complexity. This would
 indicate that my style of creativity works more on improving existing methods and pushing boundaries. I believe this would be an asset in a team environment. The ability to push boundaries and
 improve methods could mean the difference between a good product and an amazing product. This result makes think I would truly flourish in a team of open minded people who would like
 to work on new ideas and projects that haven't been done before.</p>
 <p> When gathering all of this information together I come to the conclusion that the kind of team I would like to work in would be a team of creatives. I wouldn't like to redo the same old apps with a new skin, or create a new word processor. I want
 to create something new and unheard of. Of course I do understand that in order to do this I must learn to walk before I can run. However in the long term, my goal is to work on new technologies that push past
 the boundaries of what we already know and create today.</p>

 <h3>Project Idea</h3>
 <h4>Overview</h4>
 </div>
 <article>
 <div class="cont">
 <p>The project is an app I like to call "Hive Mind". The idea is to have an app that can automate all other apps on your phone or computer. I am aware that Apple has created a similar 
 application before, but only to a certain extent. What I would like to design with this app is something that can follow and execute exact commands that have been preset by you,
 for a time that you have designated it to launch, without you being present. In addition to this key feature of automation, I plan to design the app to learn the user's habits.
 I call this feature "advanced learning". More on that later, though.</p>
 </div>
 <div class="title">
 <h4>Motivation</h4>
 </div>
 <div class="cont">
 <p>The idea for this app comes from my unfortunate tendency to forget to do something five minutes after thinking to my self, "I need to remember to do that". A lot of the time I need
 to set reminders for myself which can be annoying when you constantly have to do it. I know I'm not the only person who has this problem. People forget to do simple things every day.
 Whether it's forgetting to send an important text or E-mail because they're busy, or they forget to sign into their work app because they're running late. It happens all the time.
 Hive Mind is an app that will solve this problem with just a few taps.</p>
</div>
<div class="title">
 <h4>Description</h4>
 </div>
 <div class="cont">
 <p>Hive Mind will be able to control all your other apps without you having to be there. The premis is to have Hive Mind simulate your choices by pre-recording your selections.
This is the simplest method of automation. All you have to do is click on the Hive Mind app. Hive Mind will open up a replica of your home screen or desktop. Then you simply click on
the application you want to automate and show what you want Hive Mind to do by clicking through the process as if you were doing the command (Don't worry, this is just a simulation of your
desktop so the action won't actually work, feel free to click away). This is so Hive Mind can store your choices and replicate them later. When your done, click the finish button and set the
time you would like the automation to be activated.</p>
<p>Next is a handy little feature I like to call "Learner". This feature learns and remembers reoccuring automations such as setting alarms,
signing in and out of work, and sending reoccuring E-mails. "Learner" notices when you select the same automation three times and asks if you would like to make this a reoccuring automation.
Learner can also be activated and set from the settings panel so you dont have to wait until you've activated the same automation three times.</p>
<p>The final feature is called "Higher Learning".
This feature can be taught to read text from calender apps and set automations automatically. For example, if your work app posts next week's shifts Higher learning will react to the
time and date of each shift and set the automation for sign in and sign out, as well as set alarms to wake you up based on your preferences. Higher leaarning will be an update for later
as there is a lot that has to go into it. I want to make sure this part of the program works as advertised before releasing it. There will of course be online suport to help with any issues
as well as an FAQ to help with any issues offline. On top of that there will be a setup wizard to help users get started and take them on a tour of the features. In time I will implement
new ideas to improve Hive Mind, though I feel as though the three main features will be a good starting point. Hive Mind is a simple automation app for a simpler life.</p>
</div>
<div class="title">
<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p>There are two app designers I am planning to use for this project. The first is InVision. InVision is a free app design studio where you can create prototypes of your app. This program
will be used for the basic design and to get a feel for creating apps, something I have yet to try. The second program is called Altryx. This is a paid program for app creation, but it has more features,
including macros, which I will use for the automation and final product. I'm confident that with these tools and plenty of research I can make a working prototype.</p>
</div>
<div class="title">
<h4>Required Skills</h4>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p>To create a successful product I will first need the skills to do so. For this app I will need to learn the basics of app design. Fortunately, InVision Studio has an online tutorial
that takes you through all of the features and how to use them. I will also have to learn how to design an automation tool for Hive Mind. This will be a little harder. However, I believe
I can find tutorials online. Alternatively, my programming lecturer may be able to point me in the right direction. Of course there is also always Google.</p>
</div>
<div class=""title>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p>Upon completion of Hive Mind I will release it to the public in the various app stores and let people try it for free. The outcome I am hoping for will be an uncomplicated app that
generally makes every user's life a little easier. It will remember to do the little things we forget to do every day. It's so easy to forget to set an alarm or sign into your work app.
Hopefully Hive Mind can take the stress away from forgetting to do these simple, yet highly important, everyday tasks. Plus, who couldn't use a little less stress? In the future, once popularity has spiked, I hope to market Hive Mind as a 
paid application.</p>
